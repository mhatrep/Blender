Cameras in Blender appear as pyramid-like objects, with a hat-like arrow pointing away from the base. 
The point of the pyramid is the rear of the camera, the bace is the lens, and the arrow indicates which 
edge of the lens is the top edge.

To recenter your 3D cursor, press Shift + C. (The 3D cursor appears as a target, and defines where new objects are placed.)
