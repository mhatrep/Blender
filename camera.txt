Cameras in Blender appear as pyramid-like objects, with a hat-like arrow pointing away from the base. 
The point of the pyramid is the rear of the camera, the bace is the lens, and the arrow indicates which 
edge of the lens is the top edge.

To recenter your 3D cursor, press Shift + C. (The 3D cursor appears as a target, and defines where new objects are placed.)

Method 1: Viewport Controls (Viewport Only)
---------------------------------------------
There are three main motions that one would use in the viewport: zoom, orbit, and pan. 
Zoom moves the viewport closer or further from the center of the scene. Orbit rotates 
the view around the center of the scene. Pan moves the entire scene across the viewport in any direction. 

#1 To zoom the viewport, simply scroll the mouse wheel up or down while the cursor is over the viewport. 
Alternatively, you could hold down Ctrl + Mouse Wheel Button while moving your cursor up or down on the screen.

#2 To orbit the viewport, hold down the middle mouse button while moving your cursor around the viewport. 
Be sure to start holding down the middle mouse button while your cursor is inside the viewport.

#3 To pan, hold down Shift + Middle Mouse Button while moving your mouse across the viewport. 
Just like orbiting, panning requires that your cursor be inside the viewport before you hold down the keys.

Method 2: Direct Controls (Camera Only)
---------------------------------------

After selecting your camera by right-clicking on it, you can either translate it or rotate it. 
Translating is the same as panning or zooming in the previous section. In other words, you can 
do both with the translate control. Rotating the camera tilts it in one direction, 
be it clockwise/counterclockwise, downward/upward, or left/right.

#1 To translate the camera, press G while it’s selected. You can now move your mouse cursor to
pan the camera. To zoom, press Z twice, and then move the mouse cursor to zoom. To pan left 
and right only, press X twice, and move the cursor. To pan only vertically, press Y twice.

#2 To rotate the camera, press R while selected. Moving the mouse cursor rotates the view 
clockwise or counterclockwise. To turn the camera left or right, press Z, and move the mouse cursor.

#3 If you want to align the camera to the current viewport view, you can do so by pressing 
Ctrl + Alt + 0 on the number pad.

----------------------------------------------------

Method 3: First Person (Viewport or Camera)
--------------------------------------------
To enter first person view, press Shift + F. You can press this while in camera view to move a camera object, 
or at any time over the viewport to move its view. While in First Person mode, moving the mouse makes the 
view rotate, as if you were looking around from one point.

To move forward or backward, press W or S, respectively. To move left or right, press A or D. Finally, 
to move up or down, press E or Q. You must hold these keys to move in the desired direction, 
as single key presses do nothing.

If the speed at which the view moves isn’t to your liking, you can scroll the mouse wheel up to speed up 
or down to slow down the rate of motion. Once you are done looking around, or you have set your view 
to your desired position, press enter or left-click to exit first person view. Your current viewport 
or camera view will be saved once you exit, and can then be moved using any of the other two methods.
