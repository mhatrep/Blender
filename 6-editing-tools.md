# TOOL EXPLANATIONS
 ———————————————————
 
## 1 Ripple Edit Tool

edits to the left or right of the trimmed clip. 

## 2 Rolling Edit Tool 
The Rolling Edit Tool rolls the edit point between two clips in a Timeline. The Rolling Edit Tool trims the In point of one and the Out point of the other, while leaving the combined duration of the two clips unchanged. 

## 3 Rate Stretch Tool
The Rate Stretch Tool shortens or lengthens  a clip in a Timeline by speeding up its playback or slowing it down. The Rate Stretch Tool changes speed and duration, but leaves the In and Out points of the clip unchanged. 

## 4 Razor Tool
The Razor Tool makes one or more incisions in clips in a Timeline. 
Click a point in a clip to split it at that precise location. To split clips in all tracks at that location, Shift-click the spot in any of the clips. 

## 5 Slip Tool
The Slip Tool simultaneously changes the In and Out points of a 
clip in a Timeline, while keeping the time span between them constant.

## 6 Slide Tool
The Slide Tool moves a clip to the left or right on a Timeline while simultaneously trimming the two clips that surround it.  The combined duration of the three clips, and the location of the group 
in the Timeline, remain unchanged.
